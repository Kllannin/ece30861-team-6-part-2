# AI/ML Model Registry

A registry service for uploading, storing, downloading, querying, and rating AI/ML model
artifacts via both a REST API and web UI.

## Implementation Scope
The project implements all required baseline features and a limited subset of
extended (security track) requirements (per our approved renegotiation).

## Features

### Baseline functionality
Baseline features (compliant with the OpenAPI schema) include:
- `Upload`: upload registry artifacts
- `Download`: download artifacts
- `Rate`: rate models over various metrics
          (e.g., reproducability, reviewedness, treescore, net score, etc.)
- `Model ingest`: request the ingestion of a public HuggingFace model
- `Enumerate`: fetch a directory of all models (regex capable)
- `Lineage graph`: report the lineage graph of a model
- `Size cost`: check the size of a model download
- `License check`: determine a GitHub project's license compatibility with a model's license
- `Observability`: report system health via both an API endpoint and web UI
- `Reset`: reset to empty registry state with default user

### Extended functionality - Security Track
Extended features (approved upon renegotiation) include:
- `User authentication`
Users authenticate with a username and password to obtain an access token.
Tokens are to expire after a fixed duration or usage limit.

- `Role-based access control`
The system defines multiple permission levels.
Administrative users can manage user accounts.
Non-admin users have restricted permissions.

- `Sensitive model handling`

- `Sensitive model download history`
